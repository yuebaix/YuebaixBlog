## 邮件正文

```
Hello everybody out there using minix-
I'm doing a (free) operation system (just a hobby,
won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.
I've currently ported bash (1.08) and gcc (1.40),
and things seem to work. This implies that i'll get
something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know
what features most people want. Any suggestions are welcome,
but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
